        title: `MATTRESS FOUNDATION`,
        desceiption1: `The foundation, “box spring”, or base, is designed to prolong the life of the mattress by providing solid, stable support. It also elevates the mattress off the floor for better hygiene and a more attractive appearance. Mattressville offers 3 types of foundations: posture box, semi-flex, coil spring.`,
        subTitle1: `Posture Box`,
        desceiption2: `A slatted wooden frame with a flat platform top, it’s usually covered in the same fabric as the mattress for a more cohesive look. A posture box is not a ‘box spring’, as it has no springs, and is therefore less effective for supporting the weight of the mattress.`,
        subTitle2: `Semi Flex`,
        desceiption3: `Similar to the construction of the posture box, but with the addition of a rigid metal grid network affixed above the slats, this type of foundation is also very firm and absorbs little weight from the mattress.`,
        subTitle3: `Coil Spring`,
        desceiption4: `This is the standard ‘box spring’, and it’s usually found matched to mid-priced bedding sets. The coil spring foundation uses a spring system similar to the basic mattress innerspring; however, due to the greater gauge of the coils and the larger size of the foundation, the foundation is much firmer than an innerspring mattress. Nonetheless, the coil spring foundation has the softest feel of any foundation available.`,

        title2: `MATTRESS BUILD`,
        smallText: `The characteristics of a mattress are mostly dictated by the build, the main types are:`,
        subTitle1: `Innerspring`,
        description1: `Innerspring or open coil mattresses are build with a system of connected springs, arranged in rows and connected to each other at the top and bottom by a spiral helical wire. An outer rod is sometimes added around the outside to strengthen the perimeter of the mattress. Innerspring  sprung mattresses come in large variety of tensions, from very firm down to softer options.`,
        subTitle2: `Pocket Coil`,
        description2: `<a href="https://mattressville.ca/all-mattresses/pocket-coil/">Pocket coil mattresses</a> contain many individual springs, housed in fabric pockets, all working independantly of each other. This arrangement means that support is offered from the edge to the very centre of the mattress and means significantly less-roll together when two people are on it. Amounts of individual springs vary, the more pocket springs a mattress has, the more supportive it will be. Pocket coil mattresses can be a great investment, as they provide a supportive sleeping environment.`,
        subTitle3: `Memory Foam`,
        description3: `Famously developed by NASA in the 1960’s  <a href="https://mattressville.ca/all-mattresses/memory-foam/">Memory Foam Mattresses</a> relieve pressure on the body by distributing your weight evenly, providing ultimate support. In Addition, the flexible structure of Memory Foam Mattresses means they can absorb movement and mould to your individual body shape for a great night’s sleep. Some customers have found memory foam to be too warm to sleep on, this is why there is an increase in popularity of our Formeflex Cool Gel memory foam mattresses, featuring the cooling properties of Thermo Cool Cover and Flex Gel Memory foam to regulate the temperature.`,
        subTitle4: `Latex mattress`,
        description4: `<a href="https://mattressville.ca/all-mattresses/organic-latex/">Latex</a> can be Natural (organic) and blend synthetic latex. Natural Latex is made of white milky sap juice which is tapped from the bark of the ‘Hevea Brasiliensis’ or Rubber Tree and probably is one of the most environmentally beneficial products in mattress industry that you can find.`,
        description5: `Natural Latex has better anti-bacterial properties than any other bedding material. The excellent breathing properties of Natural Latex prevents moisture build-up, which is the major cause of bacterial growth and dust mite infestation.`,
        description6: `<a href="https://mattressville.ca/all-mattresses/organic-latex/">Natural latex mattresses</a> are also recommended for people who suffer from allergies, respiratory problems, hay fever, eczema and asthma. At the final stage of production natural latex goes through a double-washing process that makes it as contaminant free as it’s possible to get.`,
