      paragraph2: `Unfortunately, there is no mattress that would be suitable for everyone, it simply doesn’t exist. We all have our personal preferences, different sleeping positions, shapes and sizes. Here at Mattressville we want you to give some tips in order to make the right decision and help to make your shopping experience as simple as possible.`,

          pros2: `-Because the open spring construction allows air to circulate you won’t feel too warm`,
          pros3: `-Each pocket coil absorbs the weight placed on it without distributing the load to other coils, meaning less motion distribution. Good for couples`,

        cons: {
          cons1: `-Coils having the most contact with pressure will wear off faster than coils with less pressure`,

        },
        cons: {
          cons1: `-Because these mattresses are temperature sensitive, molding and softening with your body heat they can make you feel too warm during the night.`,

Latex also can be a blend of sap of the rubber tree and synthetic latex or Pure/Natural Latex. It is produced using either the Talalay or the Dunloap process. The Dunloap process produces a foam that is more dense as a result you get more heavy and firm core, the Talalay process produces a lighter foam that has more air in it and has much lighter core.`,
        pros: {
          pros1: `-Tends to be durable ( average 20 year warranty)`,
          pros2: `-Does not retain much body heat, less chance of overheating`,
          pros3: `-Naturally resistant to mold and dust mites`,
          pros4: `-Eco friendly, renewable resource`,
